# ERC20-Faucet

Complete faucet dApp using Ethersjs and Reactjs to connect to a wallet and interact with a Solidity faucet smart contract on the Ethereum Goerli network.

Faucet smart contract gives away ERC20 tokens on Ethereum to anyone who requests them.

PizzaToken is my own ERC20 token I developed and deployed.


Faucet smart contract address (Goerli): 0xa89543D9B659A0791f467e0C4E5EAf93C52DF997
